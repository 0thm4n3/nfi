User Interface
--------------
~ Application Explorer: Navigate back to application files after viewing an
	individual file.
- Color each view
- When navigating to app or file through appfilter the application's li is not
	into view (but is active).
	
Features
--------
- Security Features:
	- Provide some form of validation for plugins and modules. Idea: Sign
	modules with a Silensec private key and verify them using the public key.
	However, this would prevent developers from creating new modules thus we
	need to add a "Development Mode" switch in the settings that bypasses the
	check. However, malicious users might turn on the switch themselves...
	- Provide some form of validation of pickled saved files for cases. We
	could create individual user accounts and sign them using a user private
	key and then verify them before loading. Again, this would prevent other
	users from verifying the file unless all users can "see" the public keys of
	other users. However, if a single user is compromised then the entire model
	collapses...
- Provide some form of APK analysis
~ Alternatively specified folders that go through "Application Parser module"
	maybe convert the module into something more generic
~ Dashboard?..
- Display an indicator for loaded cases which also triggers a modal (or smth)
	which lists all memory loaded cases with an option to unload them.
- Pre-scan modules (like IDeviceVersion, could also be used for dev extraction)

Files to parse:
---------------
- Files under /data/system/dropbox/*
		
Known Issues:
------------
- Some files or file paths contain URL-encoded characters (encoded on the fs).
	when attempting to browse for example: 
		/app/com.something/logs/user%40email.com/file.log
	it fails because %40 becomes @ but the store has it as %40
	
	Also make sure to add %20 when file has space in it

Optimization:
-------------
- Consider adding __slots__ list in modules to reduce memory usage
