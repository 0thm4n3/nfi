User Interface
--------------
X Fix datatable CSS
~ Application Explorer: Navigate back to application files after viewing an
	individual file.
- Color each view
X Fix JS and navigation issues
X Appfilter add X to errase date (and join with js for linked input)
- When navigating to app or file through appfilter the application's li is not
	into view (but is active).
	
Features
--------
- Security Features:
	- Provide some form of validation for plugins and modules. Idea: Sign
	modules with a Silensec private key and verify them using the public key.
	However, this would prevent developers from creating new modules thus we
	need to add a "Development Mode" switch in the settings that bypasses the
	check. However, malicious users might turn on the switch themselves...
	- Provide some form of validation of pickled saved files for cases. We
	could create individual user accounts and sign them using a user private
	key and then verify them before loading. Again, this would prevent other
	users from verifying the file unless all users can "see" the public keys of
	other users. However, if a single user is compromised then the entire model
	collapses...
- Provide some form of APK analysis
x Binary files reading?
X SQLite File Reading for MiscParser (Catalog)
X MiscParser option to parse all files in a directory given a wildchar (*) and
	treat them as the same file for example: /data/system/registered_services/*
	or even partial filenames such as "system_app_native_crash@*"
	(used regex)
~ Alternatively specified folders that go through "Application Parser module"
	maybe convert the module into something more generic
X Application Filter
~ Dashboard?..
X Use re in ApplicationParser
X Add new tab in application view (in appexplorer) with an aggregated timeline
	showing the execution of Activities.
- Display an indicator for loaded cases which also triggers a modal (or smth)
	which lists all memory loaded cases with an option to unload them.


Files to parse:
---------------
X device_policies.xml (contains information about password complexity)
X gesture.key (binary file containing gesture hash)
X password.key (password hash in ASCII format)
- Files under /data/system/dropbox/*
X locksettings.db
		
Known Issues:
------------
X Cannot parse some Android SQLite3 views due to content providers, functions,
	etc not defined. This is why we are limiting extraction to only tables.
	We can fix that through implementing the functions on python equivalents
	using sqlite3.create_function()
	con.create_function("md5", 1, md5sum)
	con.create_collation("reverse", collate_reverse)
- Some files or file paths contain URL-encoded characters (encoded on the fs).
	when attempting to browse for example: 
		/app/com.something/logs/user%40email.com/file.log
	it fails because %40 becomes @ but the store has it as %40
	
	Also make sure to add %20 when file has space in it
X There are quite a lot of race condition issues when multiple cases are used.
	Unfortunately, this application was designed for a single user initially.
	It might be required to slightly change the application structure a bit or
	come up with a safe way to handle multiple requests.
	Fixed  by adding case_id in every request
	
Optimization:
-------------
- Consider adding __slots__ list in modules to reduce memory usage

1. Browser history
2. Contacts from facebook, linkedin, etc
3. Chat messages:
	X facebook
	- twitter
	X skype
